<a name="welcome-to-arena-fight" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-arena-fight"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Arena Fight</h3>

<p>Arena Fight is a Battle-Arena Fighting Game in the vein of Super Smash Bros. The project came about while playing the Super Smash Bros 4 demo. As I played the demo, the desire to make a fighting arena based game overtook me. I desired to create a similar game and add my own personal spin to it.</p>

<p>This project was previously named Jump Arena. Currently it is in an extremely early pre-alpha state.</p>

<p>Total development time so far has been 10 to 15 hours.</p>

<p>Watch a demo of it:</p>

is and included 4 states, Title, Main, Game, Pause
