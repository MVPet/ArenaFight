The project came about while playing the Super Smash Bros 4 demo. As I played the demo, the desire to make a fighting arena based game overtook me. I desired to create a similar game and add my own personal spin to it.\r\n\r\nThis project was previously named Jump Arena. Development recently began and is not yet in a playable state.\r\n\r\n### Updates:\r\n```\r\nSeptember 25, 2014\r\n- Completed Player and Fighter framework\r\n- Animation framework added and player animations added\r\n- Added Collision with stage\r\n- Added in basic gameplay (movement)\r\n\r\nSeptember 24, 2014\r\n- Completed framework for Stages and added a new Stage, Training\r\n- About 50% done with Player framework done, but abnormal bug has halted\r\nprogress until I can fix it.
